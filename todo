    test "homeworks/entry has incorrect type"
        use 'standardized' incorrect type error message
    copy files readonly
        mode 440 instead of 660 in install call
    use normalized keys in error messages instead of original ones
    string LabSesh::format(string fmt = "{weekday} {start} - {end}") {
        // replaces LabSesh::get_pretty()
        // ls.format();
        // ls.format("Lab {id} is not in session: {weekday} from {start} to {end}")
        return fmt with replacements:
            "{id}"      => this->id
            "{weekday}" => this->weekday
            "{start}"   => this->start
            "{end}"     => this->end
    }
    "... expected type object for key" -> "... expected object for key"
    success/error message for admin update-password
    remove seconds from lab session times
    use makefiles dir, use default if none is specified in configs
    check submission files exist before confirmation prompt
    get rid of #define's in mucs/except.hpp
    why is a variable name required here (f84aa2d test/test_homeworks.cpp:27:23)

misc:
    sanitize homework name input for directory names
