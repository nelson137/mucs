    submit dir structure:
        BASE = /group/cs1050/submissions
        DATETIME = YYYY-MM-DD
        TIME = HH:MM:SS
        denied submission basenames are postfixed with a tilde
        all submissions (including denied) are copied into:
            BASE/COURSE/LAB_ID/ASSIGNMENT/archive/USER.DATE.TIME[~]
        symlink to current submissions is:
            BASE/COURSE/LAB_ID/ASSIGNMENT/USER
    copy files readonly
        install with mode 440 (instead of 660)
    success/error message for admin update-password
    use makefiles dir, use default if none is specified in configs
    check submission files exist before confirmation prompt
    why is a variable name required here (f84aa2d test/test_homeworks.cpp:27:23)
