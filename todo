branch: main
    roster: string value is comma-separated list of lab sections, not just 1

branch: cpp-port
    don't require config to specify 'homeworks', 'labs', 'roster'
    "... expected type object for key" -> "... expected object for key"
    success/error message for admin update-password
    don't load all config files -- only the one needed
        have a main config file that associates course_id's with config file paths
        then that one config fn can be passed to Configs
        there should then no longer be a need for temp_dir
    remove seconds from lab session times
    use makefiles dir, use default if none is specified in configs
    check submission files exist before confirmation prompt
    get rid of #define's in mucs/except.hpp
    use nlohmann::json's to_json, from_json extensions instead of ::parse method
    why is a variable name required here (f84aa2d test/test_homeworks.cpp:27:23)

misc:
    sanitize homework name input for directory names
